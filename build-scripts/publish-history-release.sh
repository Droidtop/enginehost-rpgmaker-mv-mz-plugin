# Publishes a permanent, never-overwritten release for one signed bundle
# build (Droidtop/tracker#122). Shared by the unstable job (every push) and
# the publish job (a manual testing/stable promotion, which can build a
# commit the push job never saw): both call this so a bundle version that
# ever reaches a person always has a release that outlives the next push,
# unlike the moving unstable/testing/stable tags this repo already has,
# which stay exactly as they were -- rolling pointers, not history.
#
# Never deletes or replaces another tag. Re-running this exact workflow run
# (same run number) replaces only its own release, matching how the moving
# channels already handle a retry.
